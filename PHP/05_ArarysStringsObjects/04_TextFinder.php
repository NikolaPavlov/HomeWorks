<!--Problem 4. Text Filter
Write a PHP program TextFilter.php that takes a text from a textfield and
a string of banned words from a text input field. All words included in the
ban list should be replaced with asterisks "*", equal to the wordâ€™s length.
The entries in the banlist will be separated by a comma and space ", ". -->

<?php
	$ban_list = "Linux, Windows";
	$text = "It is not Linux, it is GNU/Linux. Linux is merely the kernel,
	while GNU adds the functionality. Therefore we owe it to them
	by calling the OS GNU/Linux! Sincerely, a Windows client";
//Linux rulz everywhere!
		$banned_words = preg_split('/[,\s+]+/', $ban_list, 0, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);
		$new_text = $text;
// Use a whole word as regular expression
			foreach ($banned_words as $banned_word) {
				$replacement = str_repeat('*', strlen($banned_word));
				$new_text = preg_replace('/'.$banned_word.'/', $replacement, $new_text);
			}
		echo $new_text;
?>
